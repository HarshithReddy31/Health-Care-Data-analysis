# Emergency Room Visit Report - Power BI dashboard
# Overview
This repository contains an interactive Power BI Dashboard that provides insights into Emergency Room (ER) visits. The dashboard analyzes patient visits based on various factors such as appointment type, age group, department referral, satisfaction ratings, and wait times.

Dashboard Features

* Total Patient Visits: Displays the total number of patients along with the percentage 
  of administrative vs. non-administrative appointments.

Patient Demographics:
* Breakdown by age group (Infancy, Childhood, Teenagers, Adults).
* Gender distribution of patients.
  
Appointment Analysis:
